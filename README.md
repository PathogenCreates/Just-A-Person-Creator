Create a character by assigning points to different stats, or by randomly generating them!
You are able to enter in a name manually, or generate a name from a small list of first and last names.
You can also manually type in the amount of points you want to put into your stats, however be aware that 30 is the maximum amount of points you can use across all of the stats, and attempting to use more will throw an error, and force you to reenter your stats.
The program also generates your character into a text file that is easily readable and can be used within other software (as long as they can read text files).

This was created as a college project, and currently the second version of the program is the one i'm happy with. I've also uploaded the first version, but it is very limited in usability and is missing alot of key features.
